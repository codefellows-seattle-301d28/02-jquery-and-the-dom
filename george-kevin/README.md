# Mobile First

**Author**: Geroge Ceja, Kevin Miller
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Create a blog site that is user friendly to encourage people to come back frequently. It needs to render responsively on mobile devices and desktop and display blog articles in a clear and logical manor.

## Getting Started
It is necessary to download the code and have live server installed to open the blog as it is not a published website yet.

## Architecture
Currently, this is a single page application using HTML5 and CSS3, javascript and JQuery.  The Articles are dynamically created from an array of article objects. We also used open source icons and fonts at IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).

## Change Log

11-29-2017 12:00pm - Application is a dynamically generated, mobile-friendly page from locally imported data.
