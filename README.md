# jQuery and the DOM

**Authors**: Melanie & Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We built this application in order to manipulate the DOM through the use of jQuery, allowing us to populate content to the browser without hard-coding said content into the HTML file. This allows for dynamic creation of content (in this case articles) that could be added to without losing any functionality as more articles are published by the blog/site owner.

## Getting Started
To build this app, one would clone the repository to their machine and either open in browser or run their own live server to view the content and ensure it was populating as desired. 

## Architecture
In this app, we've utilized the jQuery library and the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Some useful tools we utilized were:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

* https://oscarotero.com/jquery/

## Change Log
11-29-2017 11:48 - Application functioning as intended.
